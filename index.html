        <h3>My Experience at Mtsac</h3>
        <p>
            I have became a CS studnet at Mtsac since <strong>2019</strong>, and my first language is C++.  
        <p>

        <p>My first CS class at Mtsac was <strong>CS110</strong> which is an introduction to Computer Science, 
            but I didn't learn anything from the class because ~~~~ I cannot tell hehe.<p>
            
        <p>However, I successfully eased the baisc of CS by my effort to moved to the next level of my programming.</p>
            
        <p>Then I completed all CS, Math, and General classes at Mtsac, and I am ready for the <strong>transfer</strong> in 2023.
            I hope I can transfer to another University to continue my road.</p>

        <p>By the way, Mtsac Physics classes were so hard, and I wanted to cry in the classes.</p>

        <h3>Notes for New CS Students at Mtsac</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Java is a better choice for a beginner, but it doesn't mean you should not explore C++.<br>
                Try Java first, then you can see some simliarities between C++ and Java, so you can learn C++ easier.</p> 
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    I encourage every CS studnet to join Mtsac CS Club because it is a community for you to understand CS.<br>
                    Better still, you can find out CS events to particpate becuase CS resources are improtant to every CS students.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>
                    By the way, every CS student need to transfer because Mtsac doesn't offer you a CS degree.<br>
                    As a result, you need to plan your transfer as early as possible 
                    and take a lot of math, CS, and other STEAM related courses
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Your activities should not be limited to only CS classes. 
                    You should seek for activities out of the Club as well.<br>
                    Try to apply for some research program related to science to improve your transfer application.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Try to take some programming courses part of CIS because CS department is belong to Math department 
                    and doesn't teach you technical skills.<br>
                    If you want to gain more experience with technical skills related to programming, take their classes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
