        <h1>CS150: Assembly Language</h1>

        <p>You will learn how to use Assembly code and 
            understand how programming languages are structured by assmebly codes.</p>

        <p>The class is diffcult because takes you longer to write a piece of code.
            For example, in C++, you only write a line of code to print a message.
            However, in assembly, it requires you quadruple sytnax.
        </p>

        <p>I treated this class that is only the requirement for transfer and learn how our languages work in back.</p>

        <p><strong>I think only one professor may teach this class and 
            he doesn't go strict for this class, but he requires you pratice a lot.
            Self-teach is a method for this case.</strong></p>
