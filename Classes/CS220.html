        <h1>CS220: Data Structure1</h1>

        <p>You will learn about linked list, iterator, stack, queue, deque, and trees.</p>

        <p>The class is diffcult and is the first half class of DSA, but it is really imprortant becuase it can prepare for your future interview.</p>

        <p>All Data Structure professors are good because their classes are worth learning.</p>

        <p><strong>Note: I only have one word which is review.</strong></p>
