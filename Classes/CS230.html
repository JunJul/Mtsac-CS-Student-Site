        <h1>CS230: Data Structure1</h1>

        <p>You will learn about more trees, maps, text proccessing, dynamic programming and graphs.</p>

        <p>The class is diffcult and is the second  half class of DSA, 
            but it is really imprortant becuase it can prepare for your future interview.</p>

        <p>All Data Structure professors are good because their classes are worth learning.</p>

        <p>Be awaring of dynamic programming because this class does not have enough pratice for dynamic programming.
            As a result, you'd better learn it again online and also don't forget to pratice other concepts related to DSA.
