        <h1>CS145: Java Programming</h1>

        <p>You will review the basic of programming in the first seven weeks. 
            Then, you will learn class structure in the rest of weeks.</p>

        <p>The class is easy if you have done a good job in CS110.</p>

        <p>Pratice your programming as musch as possible to prepare for your next level. 
            Especially, be preparing for the concepts of class structure.</p>

        <p>Be awaring of <strong>differences</strong> between C++ and Java. Java is more <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>. 
            It has more useful sytnax than C++. This is why I recommend you may start coding Java as your first language.</p>

        <p><strong>Note: if you think you learn nothing in CS145, please take some time to review those concepts online. 
            Self-teach is a method for this case.</strong></p>
